              <h2>COVID safety protocol and recommendations for ITCR2022</h2>
	      <hr class="primary">
	      <p>We consider the safety of all those onsite at the ITCR 2022 Annual Meeting as our top priority. In an effort to host a safe and productive event, we will follow all guidelines and requirements set by Washington University (<a class="primary_text" href="https://covid19.med.wustl.edu/">https://covid19.med.wustl.edu/</a>). Please note, these guidelines and requirements may change. For your own peace of mind, and the safety of other attendees, we strongly recommend taking a COVID-19 test before you depart for St. Louis and the day after you arrive onsite. Rapid antigen tests will be made available if needed. It is strongly recommended that you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and recently boosted if possible. Per WashU policy, masks are required at all times when indoors on the WashU medical campus. Masks may be removed while eating and drinking (please distance as much as possible). Masks are strongly recommended for all off-campus activities. Masks will be made available if needed. The meeting auditorium is very large and will accommodate distanced seating. For breakfast and lunch, attendees will have the opportunity to sit outside or socially-distanced inside. If you feel sick, are experiencing COVID-like symptoms, or have had a recent exposure prior to traveling to St. Louis you should reconsider your in-person participation at the event. If you feel sick or are experiencing COVID-like symptoms after arriving in St. Louis, please take a COVID-19 test and refrain from attending the meeting in-person. All attendees have the option to participate in the meeting virtually at any time.</p>
